# FICS-Compose

FICS is an interactive Android app that functions as an investment simulation platform for the fixed income market.
Our target audience consists of young adults with a basic understanding of investing, as well as financial educators
looking for engaging resources for their students.

We aim to replicate the world of fixed income investing in order to fill in a large gap in financial education. Users of our
app will first walk through key financial terms/concepts that are important for them to know. Once theyâ€™ve read
through these key terms, they will be given a brief explanation of how to use our simulation, and then they will be
prompted to start their investment simulation. They will have one year to invest $10,000 in the fixed income market.
Our simulation will include four major asset types for investing: treasuries, corporate bonds, municipal bonds, TIPS
(treasury inflation protected securities), and securitized (asset-backed) bonds. The vehicles we will provide are mutual
funds and EFTs.

In the simulation, we will go step-by-step, introducing each asset type and vehicle so that the user has the chance to
understand them all and invest in all of them. The first five screens of their simulation will be more of a tutorial, where
we will introduce each asset/vehicle per month. After the introductions to new assets, our users can invest their
money freely while keeping in mind economic situations such as default, interest rates, and inflation. Our simulation
will also address economic conditions that can affect these investments. For our purposes, we will focus on inflation,
interest rates, and the business cycle (expansion, peak, recession, depression).

This project was completed as part of Hunter College Computer Science Capstone course.
